  Installation:
    So far this program assumes you can somehow manage to download nodejs 8 and also the npm packages commander and underscore, which are required for this program to run properly. 
    
    1. Install node 8
       > curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
       > sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
    2. Clone this repo then cd into ip directory
       > git clone https://github.com/snazzybunny/ip.git
       > cd ip
    3. Install npm packages called commander and underscore
       > sudo npm install commander
       > sudo npm install underscore
    4. Figure out hostname of rpi. Output should print raspberrypi by default.
       > hostname
    5. Test the program by changing hostname to ole.
       > sudo node cli.js rename ole
    6. Output should be like:
       > pi@raspberrypi:~/ip $ cat /etc/hostname
       > ole

  Additional Notes:

       wifi - ESSID is the SSID or the network name of your wireless network and password is the password for the corresponding network.

       rename - The hostname is a label assigned to the RPI device for identification on a network and is useful for communication amongst different devices. The default hostname is raspberrypi.

       ethernet and swifi  - before using these command, I checked that my network follows the ip range from 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.254.
       To change my ip address to 192.168.0.251, I can issue the command below given that my router is found at 192.168.0.1 and 
       that it is also a dns server. Alternatively, you can use Google's dns server, which is 8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4.  
       > ethernet 192.168.0.251 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.1
